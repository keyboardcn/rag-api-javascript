clearer solve quicker and learn continuously about their applications from the front end to the back end we provide code level observability to many of the world's best known companies like Disney Pelaton Cloudflare and Eventbrite each month we process billions of events from the world's most popular products getting started is super simple once you've created a Sentry organization just head over to create project here you can pick from dozens of frameworks you'd like to start monitoring decide if you want alerts assign a name and a team then copy the resulting initialization method into your code and you're done once you've added the initialization method into your app Sentry will start automatically sending errors and performance events most applications send a large number of

impacted users or whether an error is unhandled you can then inspect the issues details to better understand the problem and triage effectively you can easily jump to an issue within a specific project and environment simply by selecting the appropriate drop downs the resulting issue details page shows either details about an error or performance issue the main area of the page displays

and tailored alerts the stack trace shows you the specific line of code that the event errored along with the ability to link to that same line of code within GitHub if you have Sentry Code Cub

find areas where you can improve your application's performance let's wrap this up by talking about three ways to visualize Sentry data the first is the releases page which provides a visualization of your release where you can easily identify new issues and regressions determine whether an issue is resolved and monitor the health and adoption rate of your newly deployed app the release details
